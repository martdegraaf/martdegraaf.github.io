## Introduction

Hi, I'm Mart de Graaf, a passionate software engineer and cloud architect specializing in Microsoft technologies. With years of experience in building scalable and secure cloud solutions, I've dedicated my career to mastering the Azure ecosystem and modern DevOps practices.

I share my knowledge and experiences through this blog, where I write about technical challenges, solutions, and best practices I encounter in my daily work. Whether it's troubleshooting complex Azure issues, implementing new features, or exploring innovative approaches to software development, I believe in learning by doing and sharing those learnings with you.

## Core values

If you ask some of my previous coworkers, what defines Mart? They will tell you that I'm a determined and hardworking person. I will prove in my blog that it's true. One of the things I wanted for this blog is to show in my blog are Mermaid diagrams. I used for example a Gantt chart and a mindmap to share my ideas. Press the moon or sun icon in the menu to switch from light to dark or vice versa and see that the mermaid theme will also change. Pro tip: use `Alt + T` to switch themes. But as you can see I have not yet fixed the certification part as the title has the same color as the background.

## Speaking

Sharing makes me so happy that I try to share my knowledge through [speaking](/speaking). See how I planned for that using some lessons I learned from the book: [Eat that frog](/reviews/books/eat-that-frog).
