As a consultant when a job ends you need to transition from the previous to the next. How do you efficiently clean up all open ends? The open branches that you leave behind are sort of dead code. Nobody is going to take care of it. Make sure you don't generate more work following these tips.

## 1. No open work items

Even if you would work with Trello, it would be nice to hand over open items to coworkers.


## 2. No open branches or pull requests
