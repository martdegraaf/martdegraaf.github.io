I want you to know I started podcasting last year and the first episode went live on January 1st, 2026! 🎉 The podcast is called Oogkleppen and is recorded in Dutch.

## Wrapping up 2025

I want to share some numbers here to give some insights in my 2025.

- Blog posts: 10
- Blog post as draft: 3
- Spoken on stage: 8
- Active Microsoft certifications: 5

If you think, how can this Mart do this much? Stay tuned for my next blog post about my workflows for blogging, speaking and more.

### Books

I read multiple books in 2025. The most impactful book was "Verbaal meesterschap" by Remco Claassen. It helped me to develop my Web Application Firewall session. I used magic tricks during the talk to engage the audience. I recommend reading this book if you want to improve your speaking skills.

The company i work for 4Dotnet celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2025. I have been working there for 5 years now. We went on a trip to Lisbon with the team. Some of the cover images of the blog posts were taken there.

## Setting goals for 2026

As we step into 2026, it's a great time to set some personal and professional goals. Here are a few goals I have set for myself this year:

- Speaking: give 6 talks, develop 1 new talk, speak at 2 new events (never spoken at before).
- Podcast: release 6 episodes, have 6 guests, decide if Peter and I want to continue.
- Health : Lose some kg, strength training 2x/week.
- Blog: Publish 12 blog posts, every last Friday of the month at 16:00.

### Anti-goal 2026: Only "Fun" or "Promised"

In 2026, I commit to only engaging in activities that I either genuinely enjoy (≥7/10 energy) or have explicitly promised (clear agreement/expectation). Anything outside of that: don't do it or renegotiate.

### Review

I reviewed my goals with a peer and he asked me what my personal goals were for 2026 especially for my family. I tought about this throughly and decided to book a vacation with my family for our wedding anniversary. Thanks Peter for the great question!

## All the pancakes in the world

Let us be better in 2026 by optimizing our workflows and embracing new technologies. Whether it's podcasting or blogging, finding efficient ways to create and share content can lead to greater productivity and enjoyment. I wish you all the pancakes in the world in 2026! 🥞🎉
