For my presentation 'Visual Studio Code: One Tool to Rule Them All?' I created two fictional characters: Ryan and Eric. Both are software developers but they have completely different approaches to their work.

A colleague of mine suggested that I should write a blog post to introduce them properly. Everyone who heard my story about them, immediately recognized those two archetypes. Even other presenters after my session started using Ryan and Eric in their talks! So let's give them the spotlight they deserve, right?

## Meet Ryan

Have you met Ryan? Ryan is a young developer, fresh out of college. He has a couple of core qualities: he learns fast, is curious and loves new technologies. Ryan probably has more unfinished projects on his laptop than finished ones.

> :robot: The images of Ryan and Eric are AI generated using Sora, by providing my own image as input and describing the character traits.

Ryan is the kind of guy that uses hip IDEs like Visual Studio Code, because it is lightweight and fast. Ideally Ryan would like to use his phone to code on the go, when watching his favorite series on Netflix.

When you have a Ryan on your team, you will notice that he will run before thinking his actions through. He will push fast to production, only to find out later that something is broken. But hey, at least he tried, right? And if he is just as fast to fix it again, everything is fine.

## Meet Eric

Eric is a seasoned developer with years of experience. He is pragmatic, values stability and prefers to stick to tried-and-true tools. Eric will start up Notepad++ to quickly format his XML or JSON or compare files. Can't write any good code in Visual Studio Code, because where is the 'Play button' to start the project?

![Eric](Eric.png#right "Eric - stable, cautious, prefers proven tools")

When you have an Eric on your team, you will notice that he will take his time to think things through. He will criticize decisions beforehand knowing that changing things later will be costly. Why change when you have also worked this way for years?

## Ryan and Eric

These two fictional characters represent two very different behavior patterns in software development teams. Ryan pushes for speed and experimentation; Eric optimizes for stability and predictability. Most of us have both inside us, and the trick is to know when to lean into which.

Let's introduce an example I myself encounter often: My colleague acts like Eric. He locks his computer using `Ctrl+Alt+Del` and selects 'Lock' from the menu. I think he should use Ryan to optimize his workflow. I, on the other hand, use `Windows+L` to lock my computer instantly. The same pattern shows up in formatting code, switching screens, or running builds: you can click your way through, or you can invest in shortcuts and automation. Ryan would use `Windows+P` to extend his screen while Eric would right click on his desktop and select 'Display settings' to do the same.

The tension between Ryan and Eric is useful. Ryan pulls the team toward new tools and faster workflows; Eric stops us from breaking production every week. Healthy teams make space for both.

## Conclusion and discussion

Ryan and Eric are two fictional characters that represent two extreme different behavior patterns in software development teams. You can act like Ryan or Eric, you should use both to balance innovation and stability. I hope Ryan and Eric will return in future blog posts as well. If you want to refer to them, you are welcome to do so, please link back to this post.
