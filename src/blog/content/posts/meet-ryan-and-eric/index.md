For my presentation 'Visual Studio Code: One Tool to Rule Them All?' I created two characters: Ryan and Eric. Both are software developers but they have completely different approaches to their work.

A colleague of mine suggested I write a blog post to introduce them properly. Everyone who heard my story about them, immediately recognized those two archetypes. Even other presenters after my session started using Ryan and Eric in their talks! So let's give them the spotlight they deserve, right?

## Meet Ryan

Have you met Ryan? Ryan is a young developer, fresh out of college. He has a couple of core qualities: he learns fast, is curious and loves new technologies. Ryan probably has more unfinished projects on his laptop than finished ones.

> :robot: The images of Ryan and Eric are AI generated using Sora, by providing my own image as input and describing the character traits.

![Ryan](Ryan.png#right "Ryan")

Ryan is the kind of guy that uses hip IDEs like Visual Studio Code, because it is lightweight and fast. Ideally Ryan would like to use his phone to code on the go, when watching his favorite series on Netflix.

When you have a Ryan on your team, you will notice that he will run before thinking his actions through. He will push fast to production, only to find out later that something is broken. But hey, at least he tried, right? And if he is just as fast to fix it again, everything is fine.

## Meet Eric

Eric is a seasoned developer with years of experience. He is pragmatic, values stability and prefers to stick to tried-and-true tools. Eric will start up Notepad++ to quickly format his XML or JSON or compare files. Can't write any good code in Visual Studio Code, because where is the 'Play button' to start the project?

When you have an Eric on your team, you will notice that he will take his time to think things through. He will criticize dicisions beforehand knowing that changing things later will be costly.

## Ryan and Eric

There two fictional characters represent two extreme different behavior patterns in software development teams. You can act like Ryan or Eric, you should use both to balance innovation and stability.

Let's introduce a example i myself encounter often: My colleague acts like Eric. He locks his computer using `Ctrl+Alt+Del` and selects 'Lock' from the menu. I think he should use Ryan to optimize his workflow. I, on the other hand, use `Windows+L` to lock my computer instantly. This by the way is a concrete example that also counts for formatting, selecting duplicate screens.

On the other hand the same colleague criticizes me for when i get distracted for finding out the fastest way to do my current task. He would rather click trough instead of using keyboard shortcuts. Maybe faster for one task, but slower if used multiple times a day.

## Conclusion and discussion

Ryan and Eric are two fictional characters that represent two extreme different behavior patterns in software development teams. You can act like Ryan or Eric, you should use both to balance innovation and stability. I hope Ryan and Eric will return in future blog posts as well.
