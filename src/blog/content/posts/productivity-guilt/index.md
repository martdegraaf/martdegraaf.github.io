__Have you ever felt guilty for not being productive? I have. Let's talk about it.__

## The office == work?

With more than 10 years of work experience, I have worked in the office, hybrid, and remote.
I want to talk about productivity guilt. When I was in the office, I never felt guilty when I was not productive. When I checked in and out of the office those were my working hours. I was there, I was working. There was no guilt, even when drinking coffee with colleagues or smashing a ping pong ball in the office.

Now with hybrid and remote work, I feel more guilty. I have a family with four children and that takes time, and that does feel like I burn time that was supposed to be for working. As a result I work later in the evening to compensate for my guilty feeling.

## The guilt

If you do not experience this feeling let me explain what this does for me. This feeling makes me work more hours, and work more in the evening. I feel like I have to make up for the time I was not productive.

## Imposter syndrome

We as programmers often talk about the 'Imposter syndrome'. The feeling that other people know more than you, can prevent you from public speaking about your expertise. I think this productivity guilt is a form of imposter syndrome.

## Talking helps

I have talked about this with colleagues and they scoped the problem differently. It does not mean the inner voice will stop talking. I think it is important to talk about this and share your feelings with others. It helps to get instructions to stop, or to get compliments on your results.

## Final thoughts

I am still struggling with this feeling. If this is what people mean by Work-Life balance, I have to learn daily to balance this correctly.

If you experience this too, I invite you to share your thoughts with me. I am curious how you cope with this feeling.

### Further reading

While fetching feedback from friends and colleagues, Jan mentioned he fixed his imposter syndrome by using the 'Circle of Influence' by Stephen Covey. He wrote a very simple tool to make you think about a concern. You can find the tool at [CircleOfInfluenceTool](https://janterschure.github.io/CircleOfInfluenceTool/). The circle of influence is from the book 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People' by Stephen Covey. It is a great book to read.
