## Github Actions notes

I recommend doing the MS Learn modules for GitHub Actions. [Training modules on MS learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/githubtraining/collections/n5p4a5z7keznp5).

I also recommend taking note of these topics:

- https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.7/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners
- https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.7/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server
