## Hugo Template

[Getting Started Template on GitHub](https://github.com/martdegraaf/blogging-template)

## Recommended tooling

I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to edit your blog. VS Code has many extensions that help me write fast.

## Technical steps to deploy

1. If you want to host via GitHub pages your repository should be named `[yourusername].github.io`.
1. If you want to host via Azure Static WebApps. Please follow this [tutorial on Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/publish-hugo).

One of the advantages of Azure Static WebApps is having protected staging environments. I have not yet deployed these using Biceps templates, but I plan to in the future so stay tuned.

## Honorable references

For the technical implementation of this blog template, I worked together with Arno. We created this template using each other's feedback and code. Please check out [Arno Peters' Blog](https://www.arnopeters.nl/). He is very intelligent. I am confident you will learn from his perspective on Agile, Azure DevOps, and Azure Automation.
