# Blog in an hour.

My coworker said to me; "In the past time there was someone who did the things I dreamed of in just 4 days.". The person he referred to was me. He praised me for my dedication and courage to go fast and agile. I went fast to production with my blog and iterated from there. My coworker planned things out like the theme until he chose another theme.

## Focus on your first post

The focus for starting your blog should be creating the first post. To break the chicken-egg problem. If there is no content why should you make a blog? If there is no blog why should you make content?


## Eat that frog
One of the famous time management books is 'Eat that frog'. This book states that you should prioritize your tasks, and do the thing with the most impact first. You should be acting like there is no tomorrow.

To apply this theory to 'blogging agile' I think you should

## One-time setup

I recommend using a blog builder that uses git versioning like Hugo. Hugo can be easily deployed. This blog runs on Azure Static Webapps and Github Pages. Just because this blog iterated to Azure Static Webapps, didn't stop me from producing the actual blog content. The blog content is the most valuable. It's the core reason for your blog to exist. Not the fancy styling.

To make it agile I have made these acceptance criteria for a blog.
1. Blog has to be accessible through the browser.
1. Blog has a first post.

That means that these things are **OUT OF SCOPE** for your **first** release to production:
1. A custom URL
1. A funky-looking theme
1. A fitting Favicon
1. An about page.
1. Comment section
1. 


## Iterate

Iterating your blog should be about:
1. finetuning your blogging workflow.
1. Styling your blog.
1. Refactoring your content.
1. Learning about the blogging framework.
1. Be fearless, when using Hugo and git you have version control to go back to. Just don't commit and push any secrets.

## Prioritize your blog TODO list

Make a list of items you want to blog about. When you get new ideas put them on the list and priotize them. 
Questions to help you prioritize:
1. What blog item/subject has the most impact on your career? For example, if you write about a subject you work on daily, you will learn and become better. Another example is: you want to help companies using a certain technology. Writing about a subject helps your personal branding.
1. What blog item/subject is hardest to solve?
1. What blog item/subject is not yet available easily when you searched for your problem?
1. What blog item/subject gives you the most joy?
1. What story do you tell about what you do for a living?
1. What do colleagues admire about you
